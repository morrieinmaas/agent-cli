# Introduction to the Agent CLI

The Agent CLI is a development tool that assists you with your Aries based self-sovereign identity development.

The CLI makes it easy to create schemas, definitions and credentials, so you can test your Aries application. You can use it both for individual actions or to run automations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, the Agent CLI is on its first release. If you have any feature requests, bugs or recommendations, we'd love to hear them! Open issues or contribute through PRs on our [GitHub](https://github.com/animo/agent-cli) repo.
{% endhint %}

There are three options to get started with the CLI. You can start without any setup with our community agent. You can connect your GitHub and claim a token to get an individual tenant environment using our multitenant agent. Or you can connect your own development agent to the CLI. Both community agents are free to use and hosted by [Animo Solutions](https://animo.id). Follow [this guide](guides/configuration.md) for set up.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The Agent CLI is free to use and specifically for development purposes. Both community agents will occasionally need maintenance or have to be reset. Keep an eye on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/vXRVNh3DYD) for announcements and news.&#x20;

### Quickstart

Are you experienced with CLI's and SSI development? The CLI has plenty of built-in documentation to figure it out yourself. Just [install ](guides/installation.md)and run `agent-cli` to get an overview of the features and usage.

We do recommend taking a quick look at our [configuration guide](guides/configuration.md), as the more experienced developer will probably want to use our tenant environment option or connect their own agent.

### Getting started

Curious how you can use the Agent CLI? You can follow these guides to get everything up and running in no time.

All features are highlighted both in these docs as in the CLI through the `--help` option.
